Use `web-ext` for building. Read more about [web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/).

```powershell
web-ext build --overwrite-dest
```

> **Note**: You're going to need Firefox Developer Version to be able to use this extension. I can't care less about the extension signing.
